During my summer position as a Data Analyst Assistant (SEO) at the Ministry of Education, I supported the Child Care Branch (Early Years and Child Care Division â€“ Licensing and Inspection Unit) by analyzing compliance trends under the Child Care and Early Years Act. Using Early Years Integration Analytics (EYIA) data, I extracted, cleaned, and prepared multi-year compliance datasets to explore year-over-year, seasonal, geographic, and program-type trends. I built interactive dashboards in Power BI with advanced DAX queries, including a prototype sector compliance monitoring tool that enabled regional managers and senior program advisors to visualize inspection outcomes and address supervisory or prohibited practice concerns.

I also collaborated with the IT Cluster to design real-time hotspot maps in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, integrating compliance data to identify regions with high non-compliance. Additionally, I enhanced the Inspection Reliability Review (IRR) dashboard, refining similarity calculations across inspection checklists to strengthen consistency in compliance evaluations. My work provided actionable insights, advanced oversight tools, and supported data-driven decision-making within the child care sector
