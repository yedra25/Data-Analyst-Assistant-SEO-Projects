During my summer position as a Data Analyst Assistant (SEO) at the Ministry of Education, I supported the Child Care Branch (Early Years and Child Care Division â€“ Licensing and Inspection Unit) by analyzing compliance trends under the Child Care and Early Years Act and building data-driven tools to strengthen oversight practices.

I worked with Early Years Integration Analytics (EYIA) data to extract, clean, and prepare multi-year compliance datasets, analyzing year-over-year, seasonal, and geographic trends in supervision and prohibited practices. To support decision-making, I developed an interactive compliance monitoring dashboard in Power BI, using advanced DAX queries to provide managers and senior advisors with a clear sector overview.

In collaboration with the IT Cluster, I designed real-time hotspot maps in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, integrating compliance data to highlight regions of high non-compliance and improve oversight. I also enhanced the Inspection Reliability Review (IRR) dashboard by refining similarity calculations between inspection reports, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency.

Beyond technical work, I accompanied a program advisor on a site visit to a licensed child care centre, gaining firsthand insight into inspection processes and the realities of the child care environment. This experience deepened my understanding of how data analysis directly supports regulatory practices and the well-being of children.
